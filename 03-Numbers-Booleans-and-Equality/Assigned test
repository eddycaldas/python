# In a Python program, I have my business expenses represented by a floating point number: 99.45.
print(99.45)

# I want to express this value as a string. However, I also want to add
print(str(99.45))

# - a dollar sign (​$​) in front of the amount
print("$" + str(99.45))

# - a space and the word “dollars” at the end
print("$" + str(99.45) + " " + "dollars")

# The final result should be "$99.45 dollars".

# Write the code to make this happen.

# NOTE: Your answer must use concatenation.

# NOTE: 99.45 must start out as a floating-point value. You cannot use "99.45". Instead, figure out a way to convert 99.45 to a string.
